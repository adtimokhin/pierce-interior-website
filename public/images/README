DEV NOTE:

Note that there are 4 separate folders for the different image sizes to be used on different devices
During the begining of the development all of the images will be placed into the desktop folder

In the future that will be updated

Update:
as it says on the Astro documentation (https://docs.astro.build/ru/guides/images/), "/public" should only store images that I want to be accessed through a link (like SEO, I guess), hence, I will move all images to the /src folder
